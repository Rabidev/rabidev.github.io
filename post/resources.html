            <h2>Common Resources</h2>
            <p> For guided learning I will cautiously recomend <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Kahn Academy</a>. 
            It is a very good, and very detailed introduction to programming in HTML. <br />
            <ul><b>Pros</b>:
            <li>Basic, beginner level learning.</li>
            <li>Detailed content.</li>
            <li>Broken up into a series of short videos.</li> 
            <li>Includes quizzes, knowledge checks and other interactive elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><b>Cons</b>:
            <li>Honestly might be too beginner level. Ie. you dont need this detailed of a course to learn the basics. <br/>
            Once you start learning you'll realize that it is very easy to pick up and "just do it" immediatly.</li>
            <li>You probably don't need this much of a foundation in HTML yet. You can return to this course once you need more of a solid understanding of HTML</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
         <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> has the full HTML 5 documentation on it. It is the go-to site for any HTML 
            reference. They have text and video based totourials and can answer any HTML question you have. Every Web Programmer has this site bookmarked. 
         <br>    
        <p>For just trying out HTML and experimenting in it use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/">W3Schools "Try It" editor</a>. It will let you try out HTML without installing any text editors. 
            If you want to dive deeper into HTML you will want to set up a text-editor but for now this site is sufficient.</p>
